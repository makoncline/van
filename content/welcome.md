# Welcome to Van

Welcome to my digital garden! This is a place where I collect thoughts, ideas, and knowledge.

## About This Site

This site is built using Next.js and hosts my Obsidian vault as a website. Each markdown file becomes a page, and the links between them work seamlessly.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, I recommend starting with the [[Getting Started]] guide, which will help you navigate this knowledge base.

## Recent Updates

- Set up the initial structure
- Created linking system between pages
- Deployed to Vercel
