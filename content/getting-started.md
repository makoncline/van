# Getting Started

This guide will help you navigate through this digital garden and understand how everything works.

## How to Navigate

This site uses a simple navigation system:
- Click on any [[Welcome to Van|link]] to navigate between pages
- Use the browser's back button to return to previous pages
- All links are automatically converted to work with the website

## Understanding the Structure

The content is organized in markdown files, similar to how you might organize notes in Obsidian:
- Each `.md` file becomes a webpage
- Links between files use `[[filename]]` or `[[filename|display text]]` syntax
- The system automatically converts these to proper web links

## Tips for Reading

1. **Follow the links**: Don't hesitate to click on links - they're designed to help you explore
2. **Use your browser history**: The back button is your friend
3. **Bookmark interesting pages**: Save pages you want to return to

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics, feel free to explore! Start with the [[Welcome to Van|main page]] or browse through any other content.
